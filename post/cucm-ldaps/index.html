Regardless of the time frame though, it is important to make these changes now, rather than be caught in a rush later.\nThe key changes to the process, apart from changing the port that CUCM talks to the LDAP server on, is that CUCM/UnityCx require that they must trust the LDAP server certificate before they will connect. As most of the time access to the LDAP server is not possible, and involves working through other teams, and a lot of questions, it is simply easier to extract the certificate yourself and apply it to the Tomcat Trust store on the server. Note, that the Tomcat web service does need to be restarted during this process, so there will be interuptions and outages, so be sure to negotiate an outage window before attempting to do this.\nThere are a couple of ways that we can extract the certificate from the LDAP server, but the easiest method is by using OpenSSL. Another mehtod is via a packet capture from CUCM, but this tends to take longer and is a bit more complex.\nIf you are on a Mac or linux machine, you will probably already have OpenSSL installed, otherwise if you are on Windows you will need to install it first before attempting this method.\nFrom a shell command navigate to a directory that you want to save the certificate in and enter:\nopenssl s_client -showcerts -connect :636 \u003e\u003e cert.txt From there open the cert.txt file in your favourite text editor, and copy the contents of the cert from the\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- through to the\n-----END CERTIFICATE----- and save the file as ldap_server.cer in a handy location on your local machine.\nFrom there, open up your web browser and log in to CUCM’s OS admin page.\nNaviagte to Security –\u003e Certificate Management and select Upload Certificate. Select Tomcat-Trust from the dropdown list to ensure that you are loading the certificate in to the correct store.\nBrowse your PC and select the cer file that you had previously saved, and select Upload. If successful you will receive a message about needing to restart Cisco Tomcat. You can either do this now, or at a later stage, but you cannot proceed with the next steps until you have completed the restart.\nTo restart the Tomcat service log in to the admin CLI via SSH and enter (remembering that this will cause an outage):\nUtils service restart Cisco Tomcat You will now have to wait 5-10 minutes for everything to be back online before you continue on with the next step.\nOnce the web services are back up, log back in to CUCM Administration (not OS admin) and navigate to System –\u003e LDAP –\u003e LDAP Authentication.\nUpdate the port that CUCM is using to be 636 and select TLS as the method. Press save, and you should receive a message that the update has been successful. If you receive any errors about CUCM not trusting the LDAP servers certificate, then you will need to go back and review the cert that you have extracted to ensure that it matches that of the LDAP server host, and re-upload it if necessary.\nAll going well, you will then need to make the same changes for LDAP Syncronisation, so go ahead and browse to System –\u003e LDAP –\u003e LDAP Directory, and update the port and TLS method from there. Again, save and ensure that this completed successfully. If all looks good, initiate a sync and ensure that the users are still active in the End Users page.\nYou have now updated CUCM to use LDAPS, and there is one less stress for later on!.\n","wordCount":"713","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://martynrees.github.io/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2020-02-18T09:38:21+10:30","dateModified":"2020-02-18T09:38:21+10:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Martyn Rees"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://martynrees.github.io/post/cucm-ldaps/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Boldly Going Nowhere","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://martynrees.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://martynrees.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://martynrees.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://martynrees.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://martynrees.github.io/post/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">CUCM Convert LDAP to LDAPS</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2020-02-18 09:38:21 +1030 ACDT'>February 18, 2020</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;713 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Martyn Rees&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/post/cucm-ldaps.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><em><strong>This post is applicable for both CUCM and Unity Connection, but for simplicity sake we will just cover CUCM here.
