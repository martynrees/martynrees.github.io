Whilst it’s great that you can capture from multiple AP’s at a time and stitch it all together in one PCAP, it’s also important to remember that you still might not capture everything or what you are looking for, so this doesn’t necessarily replace capturing from your laptop next to the problem device. For that I’d reccomend using Airtool as it’s the simplest and fastest way to take captures on a mac or through a WLAN Pi.\n","wordCount":"399","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://martynrees.github.io/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2024-09-14T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-09-14T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Martyn Rees"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://martynrees.github.io/post/icap/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Boldly Going Nowhere","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://martynrees.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://martynrees.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://martynrees.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://martynrees.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://martynrees.github.io/post/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Meraki Intelligent Capture</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-09-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 14, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;2 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;399 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Martyn Rees&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/post/iCAP.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>Packet captures have existed for a long time on the Meraki platform, and have saved me great amounts of travel time over the years.
