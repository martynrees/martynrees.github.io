      <description>After much procrastination and delay, I&amp;rsquo;m finally Devnet Assosciate certified!!!
I thought it only appropriate to publish a list of resources - there are heaps out there!
Firstly, you have to study the blueprint here Take note of the keywords like describe, implement, configure, etc. They are the best indication of the depth of the topic that you will need to research.</description>

      <title>CUCM Convert LDAP to LDAPS</title>

      <description>This post is applicable for both CUCM and Unity Connection, but for simplicity sake we will just cover CUCM here. The process of uploading and converting Unity Connection is the same. This process is also the same no matter which version of CUCM/Unity connection.
Cisco have released the following field notice that covers upcoming changes to connections between CUCM/unityCx and LDAP servers for syncronising and authenticating users.
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/trouble/12_5_1/fieldNotice/cucm_b_fn-secure-ldap-mandatory-ad.html
The short of it is that Microsoft are enforcing that connections should now be over SSL rather than unencrypted transport methods.</description>

      <title>Google Chrome Revoked Self Signed Certificates</title>

      <description>Google Chrome can block you from getting to your lab devices (like your WLC) or other devices that have self signed certicates. If you get an error like this, and you can&amp;rsquo;t get past, then there is still a way without having to buy a signed cert!
To get around this click somewhere on the page and then type thisisunsafe
Then like magic Chrome will load the page!</description>

      <title>CWNP Certification Program</title>
      <link>https://martynrees.github.io/2019/08/cwnp-certification-program/</link>

      <description>This post is more about finding where to start with the CWNP program, rather than focussing on any particular exam or level of knowledge.
The CWNP certification program is vendor neutral, and is seen to be the best way to learn about wireless without any specific vendors terms or proprietary information being thrown at you, and best of all you don&amp;rsquo;t have to remember any menu structure or config file structure for the exams&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Generating a Self Signed Certificate on Windows Server</title>

      <description>When configuring a Windows server with the NPS Role in order to authenticate wireless clients using PEAP (Protected EAP), you may need to generate a temporary self signed certificate in order to complete testing, or finish the configuration. Configuring the NPS server for PEAP authentication is outside of the scope of this post, and may be covered in a future post, but this will at least allow you to generate a Certificate in order to get the services running and testing completed.</description>
