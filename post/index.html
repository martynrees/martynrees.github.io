With over 100 event triggers that can occur during the client onboarding process or normal operations, there is a fair chance that whatever issue a client is experiencing in the network that it will be captured automatically.
The Proactive PCAP does require MR31 or higher, and the APs need to be Wifi 6/6E or 7 to support the feature.
The retention time for proactive captures is 7 days, so when enabling the feature you do need to decide if you want to enable it for some or all devices. You can select which APs you enable, which if you have a large/busy network would probably be the better way to go. Since I’m running this at home with only a couple of APs I’m happy to turn it on for all devices. The other thing to note is that once this feature is GA you will need a A MR-ADV (Advanced) license to use the Proactive PCAP feature. This will be enforced in the future.
As this is for my home, I had to leave it to run for a few days and I came back to find plenty of captures, most weren’t ones to worry about as they were ones like EAPoL timeout’s that happened as we were leaving the house, but there are certainly real world examples of where this would be important. Looking down the right hand side of the page we can see which step of the onbaording process the trigger occured at (Authentication, Assosciation, DHCP, etc) and we have the option to analyse the capture directly on the dashboard, or download the pcap to review in Wireshark on our local machine. These options are available regardless of if the capture was proactive or manually run. In the next post we’ll have a look at the analysis view that we get on the dashboard.
Again though, this is another instance where the smarts of the product can help save time and effort by capturing events before you even know that they’ve happened, and can save many hours trying to recreate problems or disrupting users even further to try and reproduce.

But now they have had a refresh and not just a GUI makeover (ok well it did get that as well.), but new features added too. Proactive PCAP and cloud storage are the main stars here.
The old view served us well, and was clean, easy to use and just did its job. Now called Intelligent Capture, it still does what the old feature did, but with a newer fresher look, and now includes cloud storage (so no more losing files) and the newest feature, Proactive PCAP’s that we will have a look at in the next post and create a bit of a series rather than one long post. Nothing overly exciting in the Manual capture, but if we select to save to the cloud then it will be retained for 90 days before being deleted.

What does this mean? Well, digging a bit deeper, it only covers the Cat9k range of AP’s, so 9120, 9130,9136, 916x, etc
AND It only impacts new (or factory reset) AP’s when they join the controller running 17.12. So if AP’s are already joined to the controller and are upgraded from 17.9.x to 17.12.x then they will still use the old 9600bps rate, but then if you add a new AP to the controller, that will use the new setting of 115200bps. If an upgraded AP is set back to factory default though and joins the controller again, it will assume the new 115200bps config. So you could/will end up with some AP’s on the old 9600bps config and some on the new 115200bps config. Or, once upgraded to 17.12 or higher then factory reset all AP’s from the GUI, and then you’ll have a standard across the board, no matter which AP you connect to (that’s a Cat9k AP anyway, Wave1/2 are not impacted by this!).
WHY? Turns out the reasoning for this is simple, it’s so that the AP can boot faster!

So what is the difference?
Both are based on the 802.11ax standard, so no difference there.
What 6E does is introduces support for the 6Ghz frequency, which means more channels, less CCI, and the ability to deploy wider channel widths.
Like the 5ghz specturm though, different countries have allowed different parts of the spectrum to be available for 802.11 use, and like 2.4ghz and 5ghz, this is unlicenced spectrum*. Another thing to note, is that currently 6E is only approved for indoor use.
Lets break down what 6E actually introduces:

The Certified Wireless IoT Solutions Administrator, or CWISA is the assosciate level exam that starts you on the CWNP IoT certification track. It is also a requirement for CWNE certification.
As it’s an assosciate level exam, the depth isn’t huge, but the topics covered are broad. I took the newly released CWISA-102 exam. This exam will stay current until September 2025, as it was only recently refreshed. For study, it’s first important to thoroughly read through the exam objectives to understand the topics covered, and the depth of knowledge required.
As I’ve already had quite a bit of experience with a lot of the topics through my home automation journey, this wasn’t a hard exam to study for, and using the study guide from the previous version of the exam was sufficient for me, with a couple of read throughs. My prior knowledge of zigbee, as well as having previously passed CWNA certainly helped to speed up the process.
I always ensure that I get the official practice exams, as they are a great gauge of where i’m at in my preperation, and they also help to prepare you for the typical language used in the exam. This is always important for me, as it gets my head in the right space and can help for some of those questions that are worded a little funny that you see in ever vendors exam.
Even with my confidence, I was still nervous heading in to the exam, as you do wonder if you are being over confident in your prior knowledge, and will it actually stack up when the time counts. Thankfully it was more than enough to get me through, and I was soon able to breath a sigh of relief when the confirmation that I had passed came up on the screen with a 51/60.
The exam is certainly fair, and covered all of the topics listed in the objectives, with the expected level of knowledge required for all of the topics in order to pass.
