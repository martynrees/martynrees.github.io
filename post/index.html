One thing as an attendee that you don’t get is an appreciation for how much time and effort goes in to a 90 minute presentation. For me it was about 1 hour of prep per minute of presentation in the leadup to the event. I know for some others they spent even more time again.
My session covered Automating the deployment of wireless networks (9800 WLC’s) using Catalyst Center (formerly DNA-C).

Not only can we view a PCAP thats been taken, but we can also get some auto analysis (Meraki Assurance) on what the potential problem may be. This is excellent for the seasoned wifi professional, but even more valuable for a inexperienced engineer as not only can it guide them to the issue, they can also learn from the problems at the same time.
Landing on the analysis screen we are given an overview of the problem with the option to expand out the relevant sections for more detail. We can also view the PCAP in a wireshark like view straight from the dashboard as well, so this saves the hassle of downloading and opening the file for just a quick look. Given that the anlysis has already been done, we are given a pretty good guide that in this instance we had a problem with DHCP offers not being received by the client. This gives us a quick answer, but sometimes we might still want to dig in to what went on and actually investigate the flow of frames. For this we can expand out the packet capture to view the frames just as we would in Wireshark. I’ve selected a bit more interesting capture for this exercise. From here we are presented with a default view or profile, which is ok, but not great. So down the bottom right hand corner of the panel we can adjust the profile depending on the scenario of the capture. Selecting the OTAWireless profile we are shown the more relevant columns, and like most wireless engineers prefer, we get colour coded Frame Types. Just like in Wireshark, we can then create filters. For a proactive PCAP this might not be as useful, but for a manual capture that you’ve then selected to store in the cloud this is of more use. If we are investigating issues with retries then we can filter with wlan.fc.retry == True to filter all of the frames that are being retransmitted. At this stage if we want to get the statistics view then we would still need to download and open the file in Wireshark, but hopefully this feature will be added down the track. We can also inspect the frames from within the dashboard as well to see things like the Radiotap header, 802.11 radio information, Wireless Management Information Elements, etc, so for a lot of cases this speeds up the analsysi process, and it also doesn’t matter if you are using a machine that doesn’t have Wireshark installed, such as a jump host or similar. Whilst there are more features coming, and it’s not GA yet, the PCAP analsysis and Wireless Assurance is an excellent addition to the dashboard that really enahnced Meraki’s capabilities to reduce the complexities of wireless.

With over 100 event triggers that can occur during the client onboarding process or normal operations, there is a fair chance that whatever issue a client is experiencing in the network that it will be captured automatically.
The Proactive PCAP does require MR31 or higher, and the APs need to be Wifi 6/6E or 7 to support the feature.
The retention time for proactive captures is 7 days, so when enabling the feature you do need to decide if you want to enable it for some or all devices. You can select which APs you enable, which if you have a large/busy network would probably be the better way to go. Since I’m running this at home with only a couple of APs I’m happy to turn it on for all devices. The other thing to note is that once this feature is GA you will need a A MR-ADV (Advanced) license to use the Proactive PCAP feature. This will be enforced in the future.
As this is for my home, I had to leave it to run for a few days and I came back to find plenty of captures, most weren’t ones to worry about as they were ones like EAPoL timeout’s that happened as we were leaving the house, but there are certainly real world examples of where this would be important. Looking down the right hand side of the page we can see which step of the onbaording process the trigger occured at (Authentication, Assosciation, DHCP, etc) and we have the option to analyse the capture directly on the dashboard, or download the pcap to review in Wireshark on our local machine. These options are available regardless of if the capture was proactive or manually run. In the next post we’ll have a look at the analysis view that we get on the dashboard.
Again though, this is another instance where the smarts of the product can help save time and effort by capturing events before you even know that they’ve happened, and can save many hours trying to recreate problems or disrupting users even further to try and reproduce.

But now they have had a refresh and not just a GUI makeover (ok well it did get that as well.), but new features added too. Proactive PCAP and cloud storage are the main stars here.
The old view served us well, and was clean, easy to use and just did its job. Now called Intelligent Capture, it still does what the old feature did, but with a newer fresher look, and now includes cloud storage (so no more losing files) and the newest feature, Proactive PCAP’s that we will have a look at in the next post and create a bit of a series rather than one long post. Nothing overly exciting in the Manual capture, but if we select to save to the cloud then it will be retained for 90 days before being deleted.

The hardset of them all was left to last, after previously attempting the CWAP-402 exam a few years ago and falling one question short I reset and started from scratch with my studies.
Off the bat I will say that the exam itself isn’t harder than any of the others in the P series. What is harder is the topics covered. Know the topics and then the exam is ok. BUT just because I passed the exam, I stil feel like there is so much more to learn, which isn’t necesarily a bad thing as learning should be constant and no one knows everything. For context as well, this experience is based on the CWAP-404 exam, which is soon to be retired for the 405 exam, but I wouldn’t expect that too much would be changing as generally it’s about a 105 difference from one to the next as old standards are removed and new ones added.
I wont go in to what the CWAP exam is, as if you are here then you probably already know…
What I will say is that the first place you should start at on your journey is the blueprint. Ignore the blueprint and you probably wont get far in passing.
