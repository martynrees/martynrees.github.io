This is always important for me, as it gets my head in the right space and can help for some of those questions that are worded a little funny that you see in ever vendors exam.\nEven with my confidence, I was still nervous heading in to the exam, as you do wonder if you are being over confident in your prior knowledge, and will it actually stack up when the time counts. Thankfully it was more than enough to get me through, and I was soon able to breath a sigh of relief when the confirmation that I had passed came up on the screen with a 51/60.\nThe exam is certainly fair, and covered all of the topics listed in the objectives, with the expected level of knowledge required for all of the topics in order to pass.\nOnward we head with CWSP up next!\n",

The Certified Wireless IoT Solutions Administrator, or CWISA is the assosciate level exam that starts you on the CWNP IoT certification track. It is also a requirement for CWNE certification.<br />
As it&rsquo;s an assosciate level exam, the depth isn&rsquo;t huge, but the topics covered are broad. I took the newly released <a href="https://www.cwnp.com/certifications/cwisa/">CWISA-102</a> exam. This exam will stay current until September 2025, as it was only recently refreshed. <br />
For study, it&rsquo;s first important to thoroughly read through the <a href="https://www.cwnp.com/uploads/cwisa-102-objectives-2022.pdf">exam objectives</a> to understand the topics covered, and the depth of knowledge required.<br />
As I&rsquo;ve already had quite a bit of experience with a lot of the topics through my home automation journey, this wasn&rsquo;t a hard exam to study for, and using the <a href="https://www.cwnp.com/cwisa102sg/">study guide</a> from the previous version of the exam was sufficient for me, with a couple of read throughs. My prior knowledge of zigbee, as well as having previously passed CWNA certainly helped to speed up the process.<br />
I always ensure that I get the official practice exams, as they are a great gauge of where i&rsquo;m at in my preperation, and they also help to prepare you for the typical language used in the exam. This is always important for me, as it gets my head in the right space and can help for some of those questions that are worded a little funny that you see in ever vendors exam.<br />

The exam is certainly fair, and covered all of the topics listed in the objectives, with the expected level of knowledge required for all of the topics in order to pass.</p>
