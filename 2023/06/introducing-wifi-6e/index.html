So what is the difference?\nBoth are based on the 802.11ax standard, so no difference there.\nWhat 6E does is introduces support for the 6Ghz frequency, which means more channels, less CCI, and the ability to deploy wider channel widths.\nLike the 5ghz specturm though, different countries have allowed different parts of the spectrum to be available for 802.11 use, and like 2.4ghz and 5ghz, this is unlicenced spectrum*. Another thing to note, is that currently 6E is only approved for indoor use.\nLets break down what 6E actually introduces:\nCapacity: In America, they get 1200Mhz of extra spectrum, which is broken up in to 59 new channels. In Australia, we aren’t as fortunate though, and only get frequencies between 5925-6425 MHz Compatability: devices that don’t support Wifi6E aren’t able to use the 6ghz band, so no more backwards compatability issues. Security: WPA3 or Enhanced Open is mandatory on 6ghz. That’s right, no WEP, WPA or even WPA2! As of March 2022, ACMA approved the use of the 5925-6425 MHz frequency band for use in Australia. From the image below, that means that we have access to the U-NII 5 part of the spectrum. Hopefully not too far off, we will see the addition of further spectrum allocation, to allow for more channels to be available in Australia. Whilst it’s not the full 1200Mhz, this is still a significant chunk of spectrum which allows for scaling up to 6 x 80Mhz wide channels if required, 12 x 40Mhz channels, and 24 x 20Mhz channels. Even taking 6 non overlapping 80Mhz wide channels it still gives us a reasonable amount of re-use with a lower chance of CCI.\n6E also levels up on security, and requires WPA3 SAE (WPA3 Personal), 802.1X-SHA256 (WPA3 Enterprise) or Opportunistic Wireless Encyrption (OWE), with no backwards compatability for WPA2 or Open SSID’s, including no option for transition modes. Because of these requirements, it is also mandatory for Protected Management Frames (PMF - 802.11w) to be implemented.\nDepending on the country you are in, as to when 6E support was added in the 9800, but for Australia, it requires a minimum of 17.12 release in order to be able to enable the 6Ghz radio on a supported AP (such as the 9136, and 9160 series of AP’s.). Again, this is approved for indoor use only, but hopefully in the future we will see the addition of outdoor use added like we did with the 5ghz spectrum.\nIn another post, we will look at how clients discover 6E only SSID’s, how they discover 6ghz ssid’s from the existing 2.4ghz and 5ghz SSID’s, and how to configure it all on a 9800 Controller.\n",
