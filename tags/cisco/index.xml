      <title>9800 WLC Cat9k AP Default Console Baud Rate</title>
      <link>https://martynrees.github.io/post/console-speed/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The current long term 17.12 release of the IOS-XE 9800 WLC is feature packed, but tucked away in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/controller/9800/17-12/release-notes/rn-17-12-9800.html#behavior-changes&#34;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; is a one liner that is sure to catch people out in the near future(or me the other day): &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From this release, the default console baud rate of the 802.11AX APs is changed from 9600 bps to 115200 bps.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img alt=&#34;115200&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://martynrees.github.io/img/115200.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Well, digging a  bit deeper, it only covers the Cat9k range of AP&amp;rsquo;s, so 9120, 9130,9136, 916x, etc&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
It &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; impacts new (or factory reset) AP&amp;rsquo;s when they join the controller running 17.12. So if AP&amp;rsquo;s are already joined to the controller and are upgraded from 17.9.x to 17.12.x then they will still use the old 9600bps rate, but then if you add a new AP to the controller, that will use the new setting of 115200bps. &lt;br /&gt;
If an upgraded AP is set back to factory default though and joins the controller again, it will assume the new 115200bps config. So you could/will end up with some AP&amp;rsquo;s on the old 9600bps config and some on the new 115200bps config. Or, once upgraded to 17.12 or higher then factory reset all AP&amp;rsquo;s from the GUI, and then you&amp;rsquo;ll have a standard across the board, no matter which AP you connect to (that&amp;rsquo;s a Cat9k AP anyway, Wave1/2 are not impacted by this!).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;WHY?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Turns out the reasoning for this is simple, it&amp;rsquo;s so that the AP can boot faster!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CUCM Convert LDAP to LDAPS</title>
      <link>https://martynrees.github.io/post/cucm-ldaps/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This post is applicable for both CUCM and Unity Connection, but for simplicity sake we will just cover CUCM here. The process of uploading and converting Unity Connection is the same. This process is also the same no matter which version of CUCM/Unity connection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco have released the following field notice that covers upcoming changes to connections between CUCM/unityCx and LDAP servers for syncronising and authenticating users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/trouble/12_5_1/fieldNotice/cucm_b_fn-secure-ldap-mandatory-ad.html&#34;&gt;https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/trouble/12_5_1/fieldNotice/cucm_b_fn-secure-ldap-mandatory-ad.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short of it is that Microsoft are enforcing that connections should now be over SSL rather than unencrypted transport methods. This was initially going to be enforced from March security patches onwards, but has now been pushed back. Regardless of the time frame though, it is important to make these changes now, rather than be caught in a rush later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
