      <description>Tucked away in the 17.12 release notes for the 9800 WLC is a one liner that is sure to catch people out in the near future:
From this release, the default console baud rate of the 802.11AX APs is changed from 9600 bps to 115200 bps. **What does this mean?**
Well, digging a bit deeper, it only covers the Cat9k range of AP&amp;rsquo;s, so 9120, 9130,9136, 916x, etc
AND
It only impacts new AP&amp;rsquo;s when they join the controller running 17.</description>

      <description>This post is applicable for both CUCM and Unity Connection, but for simplicity sake we will just cover CUCM here. The process of uploading and converting Unity Connection is the same. This process is also the same no matter which version of CUCM/Unity connection.
Cisco have released the following field notice that covers upcoming changes to connections between CUCM/unityCx and LDAP servers for syncronising and authenticating users.

The short of it is that Microsoft are enforcing that connections should now be over SSL rather than unencrypted transport methods.</description>
