      <description>After much procrastination and delay, I&amp;rsquo;m finally Devnet Assosciate certified!!!
I thought it only appropriate to publish a list of resources - there are heaps out there!
Firstly, you have to study the blueprint here Take note of the keywords like describe, implement, configure, etc. They are the best indication of the depth of the topic that you will need to research.</description>

      <description>This post is applicable for both CUCM and Unity Connection, but for simplicity sake we will just cover CUCM here. The process of uploading and converting Unity Connection is the same. This process is also the same no matter which version of CUCM/Unity connection.
Cisco have released the following field notice that covers upcoming changes to connections between CUCM/unityCx and LDAP servers for syncronising and authenticating users.

The short of it is that Microsoft are enforcing that connections should now be over SSL rather than unencrypted transport methods.</description>
