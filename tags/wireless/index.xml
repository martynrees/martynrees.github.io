      <description>Because marketing people like to make things confusing, we have Wifi 6, and now Wifi 6E. So what is the difference?&#xA;Both are based on the 802.11ax standard, so no difference there.&#xA;What 6E does is introduces support for the 6Ghz frequency, which means more channels, less CCI, and the ability to deploy wider channel widths.&#xA;Like the 5ghz specturm though, different countries have allowed different parts of the spectrum to be available for 802.</description>
