      <description>&lt;p&gt;Navigating the 6GHz Spectrum: Understanding Preferred Scan Channels (PSC)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m late to the party with 6E, but in reality, not having 6GHz approved for use in Australia for so long has just meant that there is more real-world experience to learn from that others have already gone through when it comes to discovering 6E networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of the 6GHz band, Wi-Fi technology continues to evolve, offering faster speeds and reduced congestion. However, discovering 6GHz networks requires a new approach, and that&amp;rsquo;s where Preferred Scan Channels (PSC) come into play. This is actually the only method by which Wi-Fi 6E client devices are allowed to send probe requests when searching for 6GHz networks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
